<body>
  20 names of unspecified gender, 10 masculine names and 10 feminine*, from the Annals:

    <ul id="unsortedNames"></ul>
  </div>

  <div>* As the creator of these scripts, I don't personally subscribe to names as being implicitly gendered. I could argue this by demonstrating that Maol&iacute;osa was orignally considered masculine as was Naoise but both are currently considered either feminine or gender neutral, but I do not subscribe to gender as an objective concept and I feel that warrants mentioning. I have a very very complex, nuanced, and personal understanding of what names <b>are</b>, in a more or less cosmological sense, and so while I personally might consider a name <em>traditionally</em> masculine or feminine, gender is a social construct and not an objective concept.</div>
